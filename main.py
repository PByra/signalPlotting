# Note for later: Create a script that asks the user what type of signal you want 
# to model and plot. We need to create another python script for functions that 
# that can do this. Then we need the user to input the parameters for the signal.
# finally import matplotlib and plot the signal. I would like to model this signal
# with different shifts, filters, etc.
